# Contributing to The Impartial Machines Project

>Thank you for your interest in contributing to The Impartial Machines Project :tada:! 

We are working with the community to help deliver a Dual AI Engine which tries to eliminate the potential influences/bias in the news by the means of similarity indexing and version control and helps connect the dots in facilitating the dissemination of impartial news conforming to the highest code of ethics possible.

We are working open because we believe that news should be non-influential to circumstances, operate independently from any influences/bias and should be prioritized based on the importance, free of any ulterior motives and validated by employing a proper community feedback loop.

This project adheres to a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to abhay.joshi.in@ieee.org

## What are our goals

1) Understand Natural Language Processing to identify the headlines being generated from multilingual and multiple sources
2) Identify frameworks for implementing the proposed similarity check model
3) Incorporate Version Control System in order to cache the news content and check for further deviations on the similar topic historically
4) Collect databases (datasets) and construct mechanism for community based news collection
5) Develop crowdsourced algorithm to improve the Similarity check mechanism
